          Reading books — especially Stephen King (the weirder and gorier, the
          better)

        <li>Hiking Cape Town’s trails and exploring Table Mountain’s views</li>
        <li>
          My cats: Jinx, Ekko, and Mylo (yes, I might be a little bit of an
          Arcane fan)
        </li>
        <li>
          Running (because who doesn’t love torturing themselves for a healthy
          heart?)
        </li>
        <li>
          Chocolate — if I could, my dream house would be Willy Wonka’s factory
