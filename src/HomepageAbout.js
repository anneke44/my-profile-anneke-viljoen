            Iâ€™m Anneke, a former hospitality manager turned web developer. After
            ten years leading teams and solving problems in fast-paced coffee
            shops, I discovered coding and found a passion for logic,
            problem-solving, and building digital experiences. I bring strong
            people skills, adaptability, and a customer-first mindset into my
            tech journey.
